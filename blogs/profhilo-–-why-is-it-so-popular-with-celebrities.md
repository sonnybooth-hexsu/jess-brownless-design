Profhilo has become one of the most popular injectable treatments in the UK. With ‘lockdown’ and ‘maskne’ taking its toll on our skin, Miss Hawkes predicts an increase in demand for this treatment throughout 2021. Why is it so popular?

Profhilo is a unique non-surgical injectable treatment containing Hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is fundamental for skin hydration and is an essential part of a good skincare regime. It is produced endogenously (by our own body) and is found in skin, joints and eyes. In the skin, hyaluronic acid is in the dermis layer. The dermis is directly below the epidermis and is the second most superficial layer of skin. It is hydrophilic, meaning it attracts water which
results in a plumping effect.

All dermal fillers are modified hyaluronic acid. However, profhilo works differently as it does not add volume. It is also un-crosslinked meaning it is a purer form of hyaluronic acid. Profhilo promotes skin bio-remodelling and stimulates the production of collagen and elastin which improve skin quality.

Each vial contains the highest injectable concentration of hyaluronic acid at 64mg per 2ml syringe. The treatment is injected in precise points, called BAP (bio aesthetic points) in order to stimulate the production of collagen and maximise hydration evenly across the treatment area. It remains in the skin for approximately 1 month and most people require a second treatment to achieve the full effect.

It is therefore considered to be an injectable moisturiser by hydrating and improving skin quality. It can also be used on the neck, decolletage and hands. Fun fact – did you know that the highest concentration of hyaluronic acid in the human body
is actually in the eyes?
