Xanthelasma are harmless yellow lumps around the eyelids which can be easily removed to improve the natural beauty and appearance of the eye.

Xanthelasma are cholesterol deposits, which collect in clusters around the eyelids. They appear as yellow lumps or patches on the eyelids, commonly in the inner aspect of the upper and lower eyelid. They are associated with raised blood cholesterol and therefore it is important to have this assessed. Sometimes they can occur with normal blood cholesterol.

Xanthelasma are harmless and cause no problems other than their appearance. They are safely removed as a day case procedure under local anaesthesia.

## **How long does xanthelasma removal take?**

Oculoplastic surgeons use advanced techniques to carefully excise the lesion in a natural eyelid skin crease to ensure a cosmetically attractive outcome.

Surgery is performed under local anaesthetic. Small sutures are used to close the skin.

All risks and benefits of surgery are discussed at the clinical consultation. Unfortunately Xanthasma can sometimes recur.

## Downtime

There is minimal downtime of only 24 hours with mild eyelid swelling. Suture removal will be required at around 5-7 days after the procedure.

## Outcome

Xanthalasma are harmless and easily removed by an oculoplastic surgeon with minimal downtime to improve the eyelid appearance.
