Upper and Lower Eyelid Blepharoplasty are surgical procedures to improve the cosmetic appearance of the eyes and face.

The eyelids are one of the most delicate areas of the face due to their structural complexity and function. They are usually the first facial feature to show signs of aging, which include fine lines, excess skin, and prominent ‘eyebags’.

This can result in eyelid ‘heaviness’ and a constantly exhausted appearance. For this reason, upper and lower eyelid blepharoplasty surgery is one of the most commonly sought cosmetic procedures. Surgery is best performed by a specialist in ophthalmic plastic surgery, known as an oculoplastic surgeon.

There are multiple reasons why aging occurs in the eyelids. Firstly, the skin sags due to loss of elastin, which is an essential protein for maintaining skin elasticity. This causes the appearance of excess skin, which is known as dermatochalasis. Secondly, the underlying major eyelid muscle (orbicularis oculi) which encircles the eye, becomes weak and bulky which also contributes to the appearance of eyelid heaviness. Another sign of aging is the appearance of ‘eyebags’. This is due to the forward prolapse of orbital fat, which over time cannot be held back by the weakening orbital septum. In severe cases, the field of vision can be partially obscured by excess overhanging skin.

> “Elizabeth performed blepharoplasty and a brow lift on me 7 weeks ago at the Cadogan Clinic and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. She has done an exceptional job and I cannot recommend her more highly. She clearly explained the procedure always answering any questions and put my mind at ease pre and post the operation.”

Blepharoplasty surgery is performed to improve the appearance of the eyelids by remodelling their structure. This can involve complex combinations of skin removal, muscle tightening, and fat repositioning or removal. Every eyelid is unique, meaning the surgical plan and procedure is a highly bespoke process.

## How long does blepharoplasty surgery treatment take?

Surgery can be performed under local anaesthetic, or with ‘twilight’ general anaesthesia. Depending on the number of eyelids requiring surgery, the procedural time varies from 45 minutes to 2 hours.

Care is taken to hide the surgical incision within a natural skin crease or internally within the eyelid to avoid a visible scar. Small sutures are used to close the skin.

Serious complications from surgery are rare. All risks and benefits of surgery are discussed at a pre-operative appointment.

## Downtime

It is recommended to plan for 1-2 weeks off work after surgery. The first week is the most important for healing. During this time, it is essential to rest with your head elevated and use regular ice compressions. Sutures are typically removed at day 5-7. Most patients return to their normal lifestyle after 2 weeks, but this can vary on a case by case basis.

## Outcomes

Surgery is very effective in improving the facial appearance and reducing signs of aging. In severe cases, surgery can improve the field of vision.

Most patients are happy with their results, and the vast majority will not require a second operation.
