## Overview

As we age, our collagen and elastin production tends to decrease. Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the body. Elastin is a key protein that allows our skin to retain elasticity. Both help to form connective tissue and hold the body together. They play a major role in skin elasticity and youthfulness. Thanks to incredible advances in cosmetic sciences, there are ways around the issue of decreased production that have now become straightforward to perform.

## What are PRP Facials?

A platelet rich plasma facial (PRP facial) is a highly-scientific and non surgical cosmetic procedure whereby a small amount of your blood is taken and placed into a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. There are two types of plasma produced, platelet poor plasma and platelet rich plasma. The platelet rich plasma is what gives the PRP facial it's many powerful benefits, and also it's nickname - the 'vampire facial'.

## How Will PRP Affect My Face?

PRP contains many growth factors that can be used to promote collagen and elastin production. PRP can help to reverse signs of ageing and formulate younger looking skin.

## What Can PRP be used to treat?

As well as generally restoring and promoting rejuvenation for the face, it is also an effective treatment for stretch marks, fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars and other types of scars.

## What Can I Expect During Treatment?

First, you can expect a small sample of your blood to be taken in a straightforward and quick procedure. This sample is then placed into a centrifuge machine, and the platelet rich plasma is extracted from the blood. The PRP is then administered onto the face so it can begin its cosmetic effect.

## How Long Will It Take To Notice The Results of My PRP Facial?

PRP facials usually take approximately 3 months to take effect, with the maximum effect at 6 months. These effects are not permanent however, and maintenance can be considered once treatment wears off.

60 to 90 mins.
