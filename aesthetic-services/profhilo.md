#### Overview

In youth, our skin has high amounts of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid, which helps to retain hydration and support natural collagen and elastin. However, as we age, our levels of natural hyaluronic acid production decline. This can create obvious signs of ageing, as our skin may appear dull, dehydrated and ‘saggy’.

#### How does Profhilo work?

Profhilo is an injectable treatment that can mitigate the effects of ageing and provide a youthful appearance by delivering hyaluronic acid to the skin in a series of small injections.

## What areas can Profhilo treat?

Profhilo can be administered to the skin in a range of areas, including the face, neck, décolletage, chest, stomach, inner arms, hands and knees to combat signs of ageing.
