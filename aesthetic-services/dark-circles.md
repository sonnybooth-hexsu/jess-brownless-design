The anatomy of eyelid skin is complex and unique. The eyelid layers, in order, are skin, orbicularis muscle, septum, and fat. In contrast, in the rest of the face there is a subcutaneous layer of fat directly underneath the skin. For this reason, eyelid skin is prone to appear darker than the rest of the face.

## Specific causes\

\
Genetics – pigmented skin due to ethnicity because of higher levels of melanin.

Family history of dark circles.

- **Vascular** - dilation of the eyelid vessels due to poor circulation
- **Allergies**- hayfever and eczema causing hypertrophy and erythema of the eyelid skin
- **Dehydration**
- **Smoking**
- **Ageing** – volume loss and eyelid structural descent.

Miss Hawkes will take a full medical history and perform a thorough examination to ascertain the underlying cause of dark circles and ultimately determine the correct management. Treatment options range from topical prescription creams, a chemical peel, laser to the eyelid vessels, dermal filler or blepharoplasty surgery.
