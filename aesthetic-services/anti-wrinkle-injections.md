## Overview

Fine lines and wrinkles go hand in hand with ageing—an undesirable staple of getting older. Through the use of anti-wrinkle injections however, these effects can be addressed, and our skin can be returned to a more visibly youthful state. Anti-wrinkle injections are one of many injectable treatments that can offer a safe cosmetic solution to achieving a natural anti ageing look in many areas.

## What are anti wrinkle injections?

Anti-wrinkle injections are a non surgical cosmetic treatment in which several small injections are performed. Botulinum Toxin is a neurotoxin that will temporarily inhibit muscle contraction. It is safe, having been used in medical practice for decades.

## Do I need anaesthetic for anti wrinkle injections?

As it is an injectable, there is rarely a requirement for anaesthesia.

## What can anti wrinkle injections be used to treat?

Desired effects of anti-wrinkle treatment are wide-ranging, spanning from anti-ageing practices to medical procedures. However, the most common use is to reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles – this is achieved by relaxing the facial muscles. Anti-wrinkle injections can be used to treat forehead lines, frown lines, crow’s feet or smile lines, as well as a long list of other medical issues.

Another problem that can be treated by anti wrinkle injections is ‘hyperhidrosis’ (excess sweating). This is where the body produces unnecessary sweat, for reasons unrelated to heat or exercise. Anti wrinkle injections help to solve this issue by blocking nerve signals that are responsible for communicating with sweat glands, therefore substantially reducing excessive sweating.

## How do wrinkles occur?

Facial wrinkles start out as ‘dynamic wrinkles’ – wrinkles caused by the sub-dermal movement of muscles that cause the skin above to ‘bunch up’ and wrinkle. Dynamic wrinkles are temporary, lasting only as long as the muscular contraction is sustained. However, dynamic wrinkles that occur repeatedly lead to permanent lasting 'static wrinkles'. Muscular relaxation through anti-wrinkle treatment inhibits muscle movement acting as a solution to fine lines and wrinkles.

## Are anti wrinkle injections dangerous?

The reality of anti-wrinkle injections is often misrepresented in popular culture – when performed by experienced medical professionals, anti-wrinkle injections offer a smart, safe solution to achieving anti-ageing benefits that can help increase confidence and allow clients to feel youthful again.

## Are there any steps I should take to ensure maximum effectiveness of my treatment?

There are steps that should be taken by a client to ensure the maximum effect is achieved. The first of which is to avoid any alcoholic beverages for 24 hours before treatment. Alcohol can have a blood-thinning effect which can make the area of treatment more likely to bruise. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and blood-thinning medications should also be avoided for two weeks prior to treatment for the same reasons. The following should also be avoided around the time of treatment due to their blood-thinning effects:

- Aspirin®
- Vitamin E
- Ginkgo Biloba
- Ginseng
- St. John's Wort
- Omega 3/Fish Oil supplements

If you are prone to cold sores, you may wish to seek antiviral medication before treatment to help mitigate any flare-ups.

## When can I expect to see the results of my treatment?

It takes 3 to 10 days for the effects of anti-wrinkle injections to be seen. The effects can last for approximately 3 to 6 months. This means ‘maintenance treatments’ can be scheduled - these schedules can be arranged depending on the requirements and aims of your treatment.

## Why choose anti wrinkle injections?

Anti-wrinkle injections are widely regarded as one of the best anti-ageing options on the cosmetic market. It allows a significant improvement in appearance or symptoms using a quick and simple procedure.
