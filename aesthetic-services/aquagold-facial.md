## Aquagold Facial

Aquagold Fine Touch is a unique system that allows for the microneedling of a high end, luxurious cocktail of anti wrinkle serums, hyaluronic acid, vitamins, stem cells, PRP and nano-peptides. This combination of bespoke compounds is administered into the face via the unique delivery method of Aquagold Fine Touch - 24 carat gold microneedles.

## How does an Aquagold facial work?

Aquagold Fine Touch uses luxury 24 carat gold needles, thinner than human hair, to administer a cocktail of super serums that all play a part in rejuvenating the face.

- Anti-wrinkle serum - The anti-wrinkle content found in Aquagold Fine Touch helps relax the facial muscles, which stops wrinkles and fine lines from forming and can reverse visible signs of ageing.
- Hyaluronic acid - Hyaluronic acid helps to hydrate the facial skin and also supports the skin's collagen and elastin
- Vitamins - Aquagold Fine Touch contains a B vitamin complex to boost skin condition as well as vitamins C+E to prevent free radical damage, improve the texture and skin tone and to brighten skin, giving a more youthful appearance.
- Stem cells - Stem cells promote cell production and improve skin health.
- PRP - PRP helps to stimulate collagen and elastin production in the face, two proteins vital for skin health.
- Nano-peptides - Nano-peptides provide anti-ageing benefits to help rejuvenate the facial skin.
