Posterior capsular opacification, also called ‘secondary cataract’, is easily and safely treated with YAG laser. It occurs in up to 20% of patients following cataract surgery.

Months or years after successful cataract surgery it is possible to develop symptoms that can mimic those of the cataract returning. This includes glare and misty vision. This is a good time to seek advice from a consultant ophthalmologist.

After a thorough slit lamp examination, the membrane behind the newly implanted intraocular lens is examined and posterior capsule thickening diagnosed. YAG laser capsulotomy is used to create a small opening in the capsule. Vision usually improves after a few hours if this is the cause of reduced vision
