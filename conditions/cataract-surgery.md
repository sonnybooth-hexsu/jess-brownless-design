Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed operation in the UK. Over time the natural lens of the eye becomes cloudy and a cataract forms. This usually occurs around 60 years of age. Symptoms can include misty vision,glare, a frequently changing glasses prescription and difficulty driving at night. If untreated, the cataract will continue to mature and may cause substantial loss of vision.

Microincisional cataract surgery usually takes around 15 minutes. The cataract is removed using an ultrasonic probe through a 2.2 mm incision. A clear new intraocular lens is then implanted into the eye.

Surgery is performed as a day case, usually with numbing drops. Aftercare and further information will be discussed at your consultation after a thorough eye examination. It is important to bring your current glasses prescription to the consultation.\
