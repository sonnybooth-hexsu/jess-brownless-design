Miss Elizabeth Hawkes is a Consultant Ophthalmologist and Oculoplastic Surgeon. She is on the GMC specialist register for ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery. This means she consults on all aspects of general eye conditions. Having held a NHS consultant post as clinical lead for the emergency eye care service for Berkshire, she also specialises in urgent eye problems.

An acute eye problem is an eye condition of recent onset causing symptoms such as pain, redness or reduced vision. This covers a wide range of problems including contact lens related issues, red eye, watery eye, floaters in the vision, and sudden onset of reduced vision.

General eye concerns include a range of conditions affecting the eye or vision. Some examples of these diagnoses are age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, dry eye and diabetic eye disease.

Often these conditions can be diagnosed early and before any significant visual deterioration occurs. In some cases, disease can be asymptomatic in the early stages. Therefore yearly eye checks are important, particularly if there is a family history of eye disease or if you notice a change in your vision.

An eye examination by an Ophthalmologist is required to diagnose and guide appropriate treatment.
